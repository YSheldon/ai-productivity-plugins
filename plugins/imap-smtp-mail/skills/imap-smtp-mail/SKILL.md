# IMAP/SMTP Mail

## Overview

Use this skill when the user wants to work with IMAP/SMTP email accounts through the IMAP/SMTP Mail plugin.
The plugin is protocol-based, so prefer IMAP search and message reads before making claims about mailbox state.

## Setup Expectations

- The mailbox must have IMAP/SMTP enabled in the provider's web settings.
- The password should be an authorization code, app password, or client password.
- Prefer `imap_smtp_mail_start_setup` for setup so users do not need to edit JSON.
- The account config is saved to `~/.imap-smtp-mail/accounts.json` by the setup wizard. On Windows, credentials are protected with CurrentUser DPAPI before they are written, and the file ACL is restricted after every write. The path can still be overridden with `IMAP_SMTP_MAIL_CONFIG` or single-account environment variables.

## Workflow

1. Call `imap_smtp_mail_list_accounts` first if the user did not specify which configured account to use.
2. If no accounts are configured, call `imap_smtp_mail_start_setup` and give the user the returned local URL.
3. Use `imap_smtp_mail_search_messages` to shortlist messages by sender, subject, date, unread state, or text.
4. Use `imap_smtp_mail_read_message` for the specific UID before summarizing, replying, or saving attachments.
5. Use `imap_smtp_mail_save_attachments` only when the user asks to download or inspect attachments locally.
6. For drafts or replies, prefer `imap_smtp_mail_create_draft` so the message appears in the provider's Drafts mailbox for user review.
7. For sending, call `imap_smtp_mail_send_email` with `dry_run: true` first unless the user explicitly asked to send immediately. With the current tool, `dry_run: true` saves a mailbox draft by default; use `preview_only: true` only when the user wants chat-only preview text.

## Write Safety

- Never expose configured passwords or authorization codes.
- Preserve exact recipients, subjects, dates, and quoted facts from source messages.
- Treat `dry_run: false` as a real send operation and use it only with explicit user intent.
- Do not delete, archive, mark read, move, or label messages in this MVP.

## Output Conventions

- Summaries should state the mailbox scope, such as account, mailbox, and scan limit.
- Draft replies should be saved to the mailbox Drafts folder when possible, with a clear subject and recipient list.
- If a search is limited to recent messages, say that plainly.
